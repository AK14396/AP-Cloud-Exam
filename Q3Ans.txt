1.	Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com.

2.	Go to the VPC service by searching for "VPC" in the search bar or navigating to the service directly.

3.	Click on "Your VPCs" in the left navigation menu.

4.	Click on the "Create VPC" button.

5.	Provide the following details for your VPC:

	=>Name tag: Enter a name for your VPC (e.g., MyVPC).
	=>IPv4 CIDR block: Specify an IP range in CIDR notation for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

6.	Click on the "Create" button to create the VPC.

7.	Once the VPC is created, go to the "Security Groups" section in the left navigation menu.

8.	Click on the "Create Security Group" button.

9.	Provide the following details for your security group:

	=>Security group name: Enter a name for your security group (e.g., SSHOnlyGroup).
	=>Description: Optionally, provide a description for your security group.

10.	In the "Inbound Rules" section, add a rule to allow SSH access (port 22):

	=>Type: Select "SSH" from the dropdown menu.
	=>Source: Specify the IP range or specific IP address that should have SSH access. For example, you can use your public IP address (e.g., x.x.x.x/32) to restrict access to your current IP.

11.	Leave the "Outbound Rules" section as the default (allow all outbound traffic).

12.	Click on the "Create" button to create the security group.

13.	Now, you need to associate the security group with your VPC:

	=>In the "Security Groups" section, select the security group you just created.
	=>In the "Actions" dropdown menu, click on "Edit Inbound Rules".
	=>Add a rule to allow SSH access (port 22) again, with the same source IP range as in step 10.

14.	Click on the "Save rules" button to associate the security group with your VPC and update the rules.

Now you have a VPC with a security group that allows only SSH (port 22) access. You can launch instances within this VPC and associate them with this security group to restrict SSH access.
